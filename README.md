Convergent and Coherent Time Value Tokens Powered by Aeternity Protocol Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC). 

## Summary
- Hash Time Locked Smart Contract for Controlling the Time Value Workflow

## Concept
- What Is Time Value? In options trading, time value refers to the portion of an option's premium that is attributable to the amount of time remaining until the expiration of the option contract. The premium of any option consists of two components: its intrinsic value and its time value.

- Time Value is also considered as an extrinsic or instrumental value in the options trading context. It is the premium a rational investor would pay over its current exercise value (intrinsic value), based on the probability it will increase in value before expiry. This value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value. Time value decays to zero at expiration, with a general rule that it will lose ​1⁄3 of its value during the first half of its life and ​2⁄3 in the second half.

## Technology
