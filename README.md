# AeonNet
AeonNet is a Trading Time Value Tokenisation Platform deployed on Aeternity Application Architecture with Smart Contracts written on Sophia, a functonal programming language. It is designed as a decentralised application where traders can sell their expertise to novice traders. Time Trade Tokenss are built with NFT standards. All time locks are aggregated using ECDSA basd elliptical curve cryptographic security with a Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) for verification purpose.  

## Summary
- Dynamic and Decentralised Trading Time Tokens Powered by Aeternity Architecture based Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC). 

## Concept
- Options trading is the trading of instruments that gives the right to buy or sell a specific security on a specific date at a specific price.
- In options trading, time value refers to the portion of an option's premium that is attributable to the amount of time remaining until the expiration of the option contract. The premium of any option consists of two components: its intrinsic value and its time value.
- Time Value is also considered as an extrinsic or instrumental value in the options trading context. It is the premium a rational investor would pay over its current exercise value (intrinsic value), based on the probability it will increase in value before expiry. 
- This value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value. Time value decays to zero at expiration, with a general rule that it will lose ​1⁄3 of its value during the first half of its life and ​2⁄3 in the second half.

## Roadmap

- This prototype is a step towards using Aeternity Protocol for Tokenising Cryptocurrency Options Trading ( among other options trading possibilities ) using the power of hash time locks and time rage proofs, time value tokenisation and time value streaming in the near future. It is also possible to build trading settlement systems using this concept. 

- It has been a solo effort so far. I am looking forward to collaborating with hello Aeternitians here to refine the prototype and deploy this into the Aeternity MainNet as a time locked bridge to bring the might of Bitcoin into the magical powers and possibilities of Aeternity !! After all, in our voyage to Aeternity, we need a lot of time locks and time machines.
