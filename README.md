# AeonNet
AeonNet is a Trading Time Value Tokenisation Platform deployed on Aeternity Application Architecture with Smart Contracts written on Sophia, a functonal programming language. It is designed as a decentralised application different non fungible assets can be tokenised and traded at their long term and short term value. Time Trade Tokenss are built with NFT standards. All time locks are aggregated using ECDSA basd elliptical curve cryptographic security with a Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) for verification purpose.  

## Summary
- Dynamic Time Tokens Powered by Aeternity Architecture based Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC). 

## Concept
- Hash Time Lock Contract concept is one of the earlier tenets of decentralised exchanges
- The dimensions of time are different on the blockchain and off the blockchain
- Non Fungible Tokens have different short term and long term values

## Components
- Hash Time Locks implemented through the Time Stamping Transactions in a Blockchain
- Time Value Token created as a Non Fungible Token in the Aeternity Token Standard
- Time Value Aggregation using Time Lock Properties such as Sequence, Route and Order

## Tools
- Aeternity Node
- Aeternity Smart Contracts
- Aeternity SDK
- NodeJS
- NPM

## What is next
- Completion of UI and UX for the Versatile Value Token Exchange
